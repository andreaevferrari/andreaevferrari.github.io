# High-energy physicist working across Physics (Quantum Fields and Strings), Mathematics (Algebraic Geoemtry and Category Theory) and Machine Learning. 

I studied at the University of Zurich/ETHZ (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), graduated from the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford, and been affiliated with the Perimeter Institute, Durham University, DESY Hamburg, the University of Edinburgh, and the University of Cambridge.

My papers can be found on InSpire, and when it comes to ML conferences, on OpenReview. For a summary of my current research interests, see Physics Research below.

I have been whenever possible a promoter of interactions between academia and the industry. A CV highliting this can be found here.
