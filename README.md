I am a high-energy physicist working across Physics (Quantum Fields and Strings), Mathematics (Algebraic Geoemetry and Category Theory) and Machine Learning. I studied at the University of Zurich/ETHZ (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), and completed a PhD/DPhil at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford. I have been affiliated with the Perimeter Institute, Durham University, the University of Edinburgh, DESY Hamburg. I am currently visiting the University of Cambridge.

My Physics/Maths papers can be found on [InSpire](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1712079), and when it comes to ML conferences, on [OpenReview](https://dblp.org/pid/392/9865.html). For a summary of my current research interests, see below.

Whenever possible, I have been a promoter of interactions between academia and the industry. For some of what I have done so far, see below.

I also have an academic background in Philosophy. In fact, I first went into Physics and Maths because I was curious to understand better the boundaries of what science can tell us about the world. These kind of questions have never abandoned me. If you are interested in them too, feel free to contact me.

I am passionate about hiking, music, and a few other things. For more details, see below.
