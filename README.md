I am a high-energy physicist working across Physics (Quantum Fields and Strings), Mathematics (Algebraic Geoemetry and Category Theory) and Machine Learning.

<p style="font-size:10px">
  
I studied at the University of Zurich/ETHZ (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), and completed a PhD/DPhil at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford. My MSc advisor was Niklas Beisert, my DPhil supervisor Lionel Mason. I have been affiliated with the Perimeter Institute, Durham University, the University of Edinburgh, DESY Hamburg. I am currently visiting the University of Cambridge.

My Physics/Maths papers can be found on [InSpire](https://inspirehep.net/authors/1712079), and when it comes to ML conferences, on [OpenReview](https://openreview.net/profile?id=~Andrea_E._V._Ferrari1). See below for a quick summary of my interests, and links to sample talks and slide decks.

<p style="font-size:10px">
  
Broadly speaking, I have been pioneering the following research directions:

-Describe observables of 3d SUSY gauge theories exploting the geometry of vortex and quasi-map moduli spaces. See a sample [talk]() and a [slide deck]().
-Understand 2d chiral CFTs (VOAs) that arise at the boundary of tolopogically twisted 3d QFTs in terms of the vacuum geometry of the 3d theory. See a sample [talk]() and a [slide deck]().
-Understand generalised symmetries in QFT in terms of higher representation theory, opening up the understanding of their representations. See a sample [talk]() and a [slide deck]().
-Understand the relation between moduli spaces of Berry connections of QFT systems/periodic monopoles and generalised cohomology. See a sample [talk]() and [slide deck]().

I am currently working on the following:

-Use chiralisation techniques to describe geometrically spaces of conformal blocks of chiral CFTs.
-Use chiralisation techniques to understand AdS/CFT holography at minimal string tension.
-Understand more thoroughly the deep relationship between Berry phases and generalised cohomology.
-Use higher geoemtry to understand generalised symmetries and their representations.

Whenever possible (such as during the pandemic), I have been a promoter of interactions between academia and the industry. Click for a quick summary of what I've done so far.

I believe that whenever there is the opportunity for academics to have an impact besides their domain of research, it ought to be taken. Over the years, I have used maths and ML competences to do work on and advise on risk management, megaproject management, and as I come from a family of builders, construction more generally. Contact me if you'd like to hear more.

Perhaps surprisingly, I also have an academic background in Philosophy. It remains one of my hobbies.

<summary>Philosophy Background and Interests</summary>

<br>

I have been passionate about Philosophy, both continental and analytic. I did some Philosophy in my undergrad and completed with distinction an MSt in Philosophy of Physics at the University of Oxford. I wrote essays on epistemology, philosophy of science, and philosophy of physics. In my leisure time, I am currently thinking about how the foundations of mathematics impact the construction of physical theories. If you are at all curious about this, feel free to contact me.

I am passionate about music, hiking (especially around the mountains my family has been living in for ~600 years, as well as high-altitude volcanos), and a few other things.
