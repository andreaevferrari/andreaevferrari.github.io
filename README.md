I am a high-energy physicist working across Physics (Quantum Fields and Strings), Mathematics (Algebraic Geoemetry and Category Theory) and Machine Learning. I studied at the University of Zurich/ETHZ (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology), and completed a PhD/DPhil at the Mathematical Institute of the University of Oxford. I have been affiliated with the Perimeter Institute, Durham University, the University of Edinburgh, DESY Hamburg, and the University of Cambridge.

My papers can be found on InSpire, and when it comes to ML conferences, on OpenReview. For a summary of my current research interests, see below.

I have pioneered several research directions:

- The relationship between supersymmetry localisation formulas in 3d SUSY gauge theories, the geometry of vortex moduli spaces, and the enumerative geometry of quasi-map spaces
- 
- Higher represenation theory
